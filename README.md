<h3><ins>SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR (GUI)</br> Using Algorithm and Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming (C#)</ins></h3>
<h3>üî∑Description</h3>
By using this GUI based calculator like mathematical tool can simplify
everyday problems and tasks. Calculations and organized and reliable,
making error-prone hand calculations unnecessary. The calculator is very
easy to use, and even for beginners. Physically, the calculator is thin and light
for optimal portability. Aesthetically, it is sleek and stylish, without
sacrificing ergonomics. Because this calculator is portable, easy to use, and
drains little power, it could be used extensively in third world countries.
Several fields are greatly improved by the calculator, including education,
commerce, and scientific research.

<h3>üî∑DEVELOPMENT</h3>
Acknowledging that it is difficult to appeal to students with varying levels of
experience, perhaps there could be some more instruction on programming for
less experienced students. The code reviews were also helpful.</br></br>
